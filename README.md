# Create Web App
 Set up a modern web app by running zero commands.

Create Web App works on macOS, Windows, Linux, and anywhere else a web browser can be executed.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/de1ane1ra/create-web-app/issues/new).<br>

If you've previously installed `create-web-app` globally via `npm install -g create-web-app`, I recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-web-app`, then, [uninstall npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/removing-npm).

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.<br>
They aren't utilized or hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create something, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:
- Write the code yourself.
- Have your friend(s) write the code with you.

### Clone This Repository

```sh
git clone http://github.com/de1ane1ra/create-web-app
```

A directory with the name `create-web-app` will be created inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, will be the initial project structure and its transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── index.html
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd create-web-app
```

Then open `create-web-app/index.html` in your browser of choice to see your app.<br>

Inside the newly created project, you can't run any built-in commands.

At any time, your app is ready to be deployed.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, drop the contents of your project folder on your server.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using Create Web App throughout limitless standardized documents throughout the world and world wide web. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great place to start or to use as a reference, but I would refrain from limiting yourself to a single source of information.

## How to Update to New Versions?

Don't.

## Philosophy

- **Fewest Dependencies:** In reality, there are inherent dependencies to achieving anything in most computing environments. Software built for the web more than others, often times. To say this project has zero dependencies would be unrealistic, but it does make attempts to rely only on those dependencies which are fundamental to providing a web page to you or your intended audience.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

- **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time.

## What’s Included?

Not very much.

Check out [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The good news is that **these tools are not preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your philosophy and/or needs are different, make changes. Better yet, don't use this at all.

## Popular Alternatives

Alternatives to building websites with Create Web App are plentiful. Explore your options and decide what is best for you as the designer and for your design.
